# **Face Detector App using PERN Stack**

- ### It detects the faces present in an image and creates a box around it and counts them.

---

- ### For the face detection I have used Clarifai API model, link is provided below
  - [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/ai-face-detection)

---

- ### In addition to this I have used user authentication for user registration and login so first user has to register on to the app before using it.

---

- ### I have used **PostgreSQL** database to store the user data, **NodeJS** & **ExpressJS** for the backend purpose and **React** for the frontend.

---

- ### React app is deployed on **GitHub Pages** and Node app is deployed on **Heroku** and database is created on the same.
